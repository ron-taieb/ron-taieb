# 👋 Hi, I’m @ron-taieb

- 👀 I’m interested in **data science**, particularly **deep learning**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, **statistical modeling**, and **computational musicology**.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my **thesis in computational musicology**, where I apply deep learning techniques to analyze musical patterns. I’m also learning **advanced deep learning techniques**, **diffusion models**, and exploring **novel AI applications** in text and image generation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **data science projects** involving **NLP**, **generative models**, **music analysis**, and **computational musicology**.
- 📫 You can reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ron-taieb-7991231bb/) or explore my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/ron-taieb).
